# Anti-Narcoleptic Alarm System
I've Designed and integrated smart glasses with Arduino Nano using Embedded C programming that alerts the user with a buzzing sound  if the user is experiencing Narcolepsy.

## Project Description

Imagine wearing a pair of eyeglasses that keeps you alert and focused throughout the day. Our Anti-Sleep Alarm System does just that! The system seamlessly integrates with your vision, monitoring your eye blinks and triggering gentle yet effective alerts when you're showing signs of drowsiness or fatigue.

## Key Features

- **Drowsiness Detection:** The system uses an eye blink sensor to detect extended eye closure (over 1.5 seconds), indicating potential sleepiness.
- **Multi-Modal Alerting:** Upon detecting drowsiness, the system activates two alert mechanisms:
  - Passive Buzzer: Emits a gentle but noticeable sound to break through drowsiness.
  - Coin Vibration Motor: Provides haptic feedback through vibrations on the temple area, offering a discreet and effective wake-up call.
- **Lightweight and Comfortable:** The system is designed to be worn comfortably on your existing eyeglasses, ensuring minimal disruption to your daily activities.

### How It Works

The eye glasses are worn by the user, and the eye blink sensor continuously monitors for signs of drowsiness. If the sensor detects the user closing their eyes for more than 1.5 seconds, the system is triggered. This leads to the activation of the passive buzzer, emitting an audible alert, and the coin vibration motor starts vibrating, providing haptic feedback to wake up the user.

## Components Used

1. **Eye Blink Sensor:** Monitors the user's eye activity.
